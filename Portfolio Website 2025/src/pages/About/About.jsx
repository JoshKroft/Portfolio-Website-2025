                    <strong>I'm a Senior studying Computer Science at Missouri S&T</strong> with a passionate drive for software development and graphic design.
                    Since 2023, I've been designing various products for ACM Hack such as stickers, sweaters, and more importantly websites. I design the 
                    websites using Figma and other products with Canva such as recruitment flyers. I recently joined ACM Web to further enhance my skills into becoming a web developer
                    such as learning more about how to use React.

                    Outside of school and ACM, I am very proud of becoming an Eagle Scout back in 2021. In which I lead through example to finish my 
                    Eagle Scout Project by having volunteers help me remove weeds and plant flowers at a local FireStation in my hometown.
                    I enjoy helping others and being a creative thinker that solves problems in unique ways. I now aspire to expand my technical skills through academic and personal projects.
